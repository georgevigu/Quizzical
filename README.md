# Quizzical

This project is the final project of Bob Ziroll's free React course.  
Made from scratch by me using HTML, CSS, and ReactJS.

The app takes 5 random questions from the Open Trivia Databse API.

Users can select answers and then check how many they got right!  
Then the game can be restarted.
